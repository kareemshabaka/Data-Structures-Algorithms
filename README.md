# Data-Structures-Algorithms
Exploring data structures and algorithms as part of a second-year course at McMaster.

These 4 files are the most complex and difficult assignemnts I completed throughout the course. They explore polymorphism, trees, and linked lists. Some of the code in
SearchTrees.cpp has been provided for us as a base, but many of the functions were written by me.
